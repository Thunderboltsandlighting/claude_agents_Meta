## Mental Health Keyword Nuances

### Important Considerations:

**2. Professional vs. Lay Terms**
- Professional: "Major Depressive Disorder"
- Search terms: "depression symptoms," "feeling depressed"
- Use: Lay terms in content, professional terms for credibility

**3. Stigma-Sensitive Language**
- Avoid: "mental illness," "suffering from"
- Prefer: "mental health concerns," "living with"
- Person-first language

**4. Treatment Modality Keywords**
- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
- DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy)
- These often have high search volume but educational intent
