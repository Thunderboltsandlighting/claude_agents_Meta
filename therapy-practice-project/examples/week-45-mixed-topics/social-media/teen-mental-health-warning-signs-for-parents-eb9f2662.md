**ðŸ§¡ Teen Mental Health: Know the Signs**

As parents in Western NC, watching our teens navigate today's challenges can feel overwhelming. While some mood changes are normal during adolescence, certain signs may indicate your teen could benefit from additional support.

**Key signs to notice:**
â€¢ Persistent changes in sleep or eating patterns
â€¢ Withdrawal from family, friends, or activities they once enjoyed
â€¢ Significant drops in academic performance
â€¢ Increased irritability or emotional outbursts
â€¢ Physical complaints without clear medical cause
â€¢ Expressing feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness

**Remember:** You know your teen best. Trust your instincts when something feels different.

Early support can make a profound difference in your teen's wellbeing and future. At Hendersonville Counseling, we create a safe, non-judgmental space where teens feel heard and understood.

**Ready to take the next step?** Contact us today for a consultation to discuss how we can support your family's journey toward healing and connection.

*Your teen's mental health matters, and so does your peace of mind.* ðŸ’™
