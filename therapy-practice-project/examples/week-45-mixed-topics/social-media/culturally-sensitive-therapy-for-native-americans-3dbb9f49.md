**Honoring Cultural Heritage in Mental Health Care**

Native American communities have rich traditions of healing that honor the connection between mind, body, and spirit. At Hendersonville Counseling, we recognize that effective therapy must respect and integrate these cultural values.

**What makes therapy culturally sensitive for Native Americans?**
• Understanding the importance of community and extended family relationships
• Respecting traditional healing practices and spiritual beliefs
• Recognizing historical trauma and its generational impact
• Creating space for storytelling as a therapeutic tool
• Honoring the connection to nature and ancestral wisdom

**Finding the right fit matters.** When seeking mental health support, it's important to find a therapist who:
- Listens without judgment
- Asks about your cultural background and values
- Is willing to learn about your traditions
- Integrates your beliefs into the therapeutic process

Every individual deserves mental health care that honors who they are and where they come from. If you're in Western NC and seeking culturally aware therapy, we're here to listen and support your healing journey.
