**MAIN CAPTION:**

November is National Family Caregivers Month, recognizing the millions who provide unpaid care to loved ones. Research shows that 61% of family caregivers experience high levels of emotional stress, often leading to caregiver burnout.

**Signs you may need additional support:**
• Persistent feelings of overwhelm or exhaustion
• Difficulty maintaining personal relationships
• Changes in sleep or appetite patterns
• Increased irritability or emotional reactivity
• Neglecting your own health needs

**Evidence-based coping strategies:**
✓ Establish clear boundaries around caregiving responsibilities
✓ Practice scheduled self-care activities (even 10-15 minutes daily)
✓ Connect with caregiver support groups or communities
✓ Utilize respite care services when available
✓ Maintain regular medical and mental health check-ups

Caregiving can be one of life's most meaningful yet challenging experiences. Professional support can provide you with personalized coping strategies and emotional processing tools.
