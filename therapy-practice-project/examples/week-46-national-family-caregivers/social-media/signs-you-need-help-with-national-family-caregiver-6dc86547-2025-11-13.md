ðŸ«¶ **National Family Caregivers Month: Recognizing When You Need Support**

Caregiving can be one of life's most meaningful yet challenging roles. Research shows that family caregivers experience elevated stress levels, which can impact both physical and mental well-being.

**Signs you may benefit from professional support:**
â€¢ Persistent feelings of overwhelm or isolation
â€¢ Changes in sleep patterns or appetite
â€¢ Difficulty managing emotions or increased irritability
â€¢ Neglecting your own health needs
â€¢ Strained relationships with family or friends
â€¢ Feeling guilty when taking time for yourself

**Evidence-based strategies that help:**
âœ“ Setting realistic boundaries and expectations
âœ“ Building a support network
âœ“ Practicing stress-reduction techniques
âœ“ Prioritizing self-care without guilt

Remember: Seeking support isn't a sign of weaknessâ€”it's essential for sustainable caregiving. When you care for yourself, you're better equipped to care for others.

At Hendersonville Counseling, we understand the unique challenges Western NC families face. Our therapists provide specialized support for caregivers navigating stress, anxiety, and life transitions.
