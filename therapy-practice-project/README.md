## Customization

### Modify Agent Behavior

Edit `agents/[agent-name]/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  temperature: 0.6    # Adjust creativity
  max_tokens: 7000    # Adjust output length
```

### Add Custom Slash Commands

Create new commands in `../Claude-Agents/slash-commands/`:

```markdown
# /crisis-response.md

When a social media comment indicates crisis or self-harm:

1. DO NOT attempt to provide therapy
2. Respond with: "Thank you for reaching out. If you're in crisis, please contact:
   - 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
   - 911 for emergencies
   - Local crisis center: [your local resource]"
3. Follow up via DM with resources
4. Document interaction for practice records
```

### Create Additional Agents

```bash
cd ../Claude-Agents

python core/cli.py create \
  --name therapy-practice-insurance-specialist \
  --template base_agent \
  --output ../therapy-practice-project/agents
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Loading

```python
# Use dynamic module loading
import importlib.util

def load_module(name, path):
    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name, path)
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    return module
```

### Dashboard Data Issues

```python
# Validate data structure
required_fields = ['revenue', 'new_clients', 'total_sessions']
for field in required_fields:
    assert field in practice_data, f"Missing {field}"
```

### Workflow Timing

```bash
# Use cron for automation (Linux/Mac)
# Monday 9am: Business analysis
0 9 * * 1 python /path/to/therapy_practice_workflow.py --monday

# Tuesday 10am: Content strategy
0 10 * * 2 python /path/to/therapy_practice_workflow.py --tuesday
```
