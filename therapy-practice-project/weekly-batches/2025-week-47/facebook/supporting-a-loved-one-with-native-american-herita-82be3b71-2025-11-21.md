**MAIN CAPTION/POST TEXT:**

This Native American Heritage Month, we honor the rich traditions, resilience, and strength of Native communities while acknowledging the unique mental health challenges many face. If you're supporting a loved one with Native American heritage, your understanding and compassion can make a profound difference.

**Ways to offer meaningful support:**
• Listen without judgment and create safe spaces for sharing
• Learn about their cultural background and honor their traditions
• Understand that historical trauma can impact mental health across generations
• Respect their connection to community, land, and spiritual practices
• Encourage professional support when needed, while honoring cultural values

Mental health struggles don't define anyone's strength. Native communities have shown incredible resilience throughout history, and that same strength can guide healing journeys today.

At Hendersonville Counseling, we're committed to providing culturally sensitive care that honors each person's unique background and experiences. Our trauma-informed approach, including EMDR therapy, can help address generational trauma while respecting cultural identity.

Your loved one deserves support that understands their whole story. We're here to help when you're ready.
