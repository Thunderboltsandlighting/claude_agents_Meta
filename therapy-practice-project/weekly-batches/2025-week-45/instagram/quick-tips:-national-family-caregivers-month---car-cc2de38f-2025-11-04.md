**MAIN CAPTION:**

November is National Family Caregivers Month ðŸ’™ To all the family caregivers in Hendersonville and Western NC - your dedication doesn't go unnoticed.

Caring for a loved one can be both rewarding and overwhelming. Here are gentle reminders for your journey:

âœ¨ **Self-care isn't selfish** - You can't pour from an empty cup
âœ¨ **Set boundaries** - It's okay to say "I need help" or "I need a break"
âœ¨ **Accept support** - Whether from friends, family, or professional respite care
âœ¨ **Honor your feelings** - Guilt, frustration, and exhaustion are normal parts of caregiving
âœ¨ **Stay connected** - Isolation can intensify stress and depression

Remember: Taking care of yourself IS taking care of your loved one. When you're emotionally and physically healthy, you can provide better care.

If caregiving stress is affecting your mental health, relationships, or daily life, you don't have to navigate this alone. Professional support can help you develop coping strategies, process difficult emotions, and find balance.

Ready to prioritize your wellbeing? Let's talk about how therapy can support you on this journey.
