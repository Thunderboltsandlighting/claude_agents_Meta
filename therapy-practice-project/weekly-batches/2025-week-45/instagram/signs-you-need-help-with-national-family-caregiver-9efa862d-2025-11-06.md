**Caring for a loved one? You're a hero, but even heroes need support. ðŸ’™**

This National Family Caregivers Month, we honor the incredible strength of Western NC's caregivers. But sometimes the weight of caring for others can feel overwhelming.

**Signs you might need support:**
â€¢ Feeling exhausted even after rest
â€¢ Neglecting your own needs consistently
â€¢ Increased irritability or sadness
â€¢ Difficulty sleeping or concentrating
â€¢ Feeling guilty when taking breaks
â€¢ Physical symptoms like headaches or tension

**You deserve care too.** Taking time for your mental health isn't selfishâ€”it's essential. When you're supported, you can better support those you love.

**Small steps that help:**
âœ“ Schedule 10 minutes daily for yourself
âœ“ Connect with other caregivers
âœ“ Accept help when offered
âœ“ Practice saying "no" to extra commitments

Remember, seeking therapy isn't a sign of weaknessâ€”it's a sign of wisdom. You matter, and your wellbeing matters.

Ready to prioritize your mental health? Let's talk about how therapy can support you through your caregiving journey. ðŸŒŸ
