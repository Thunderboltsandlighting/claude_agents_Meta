**Myth-busting for National Family Caregivers Month ðŸ’™**

Hendersonville families, let's address some common misconceptions about caregiving:

**MYTH:** "Good caregivers don't need help themselves"
**REALITY:** Self-care isn't selfishâ€”it's essential. You can't pour from an empty cup.

**MYTH:** "Feeling overwhelmed means you're not cut out for this"
**REALITY:** Caregiving is one of life's most challenging roles. Feeling stressed is completely normal and valid.

**MYTH:** "Only family members can be 'real' caregivers"
**REALITY:** Caregiving comes in many formsâ€”biological family, chosen family, friends, and community members all make meaningful differences.

**MYTH:** "Seeking therapy means you're failing as a caregiver"
**REALITY:** Therapy provides essential tools for managing stress, setting boundaries, and maintaining your mental health while caring for others.

Your wellbeing matters just as much as those you're caring for. At Hendersonville Counseling, we understand the unique challenges Western NC caregivers faceâ€”from juggling responsibilities to managing caregiver fatigue.
