## MAIN CAPTION/POST TEXT:

ðŸ’™ **When someone you love is experiencing a panic attack, your presence can make all the difference.**

Panic attacks can feel overwhelming and frightening, both for the person experiencing them and their loved ones. Here are gentle ways to offer support:

âœ¨ **Stay calm and present** - Your steady energy helps ground them
âœ¨ **Use reassuring words** - "You're safe," "This will pass," "I'm here with you"
âœ¨ **Encourage slow breathing** - Breathe with them, count together
âœ¨ **Respect their space** - Ask before touching; some find it comforting, others don't
âœ¨ **Don't minimize** - Avoid saying "just relax" or "it's all in your head"
âœ¨ **Create a safety plan together** during calm moments

Remember, supporting someone through anxiety takes patience and understanding. You don't have to have all the answers - sometimes just being there is enough.

If panic attacks are affecting your family, know that help is available right here in Hendersonville. Our compassionate team understands what you're going through and can provide tools and strategies that work.
