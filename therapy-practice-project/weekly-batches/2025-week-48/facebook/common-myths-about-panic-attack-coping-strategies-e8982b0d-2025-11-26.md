## MAIN CAPTION/POST TEXT:

**Myth-Busting Monday: What Really Helps During Panic Attacks? üíô**

Living in our beautiful Western NC mountains, I often hear folks share well-meaning but unhelpful advice about panic attacks. Let's clear up some common myths:

‚ùå **Myth**: "Just breathe deeply and you'll be fine"
‚úÖ **Reality**: Deep breathing can sometimes make panic worse. Gentle, normal breathing often works better.

‚ùå **Myth**: "You need to stop the panic attack immediately"
‚úÖ **Reality**: Fighting panic often intensifies it. Learning to ride the wave with self-compassion is more effective.

‚ùå **Myth**: "Avoiding triggers will solve the problem"
‚úÖ **Reality**: While temporary relief helps, gradual exposure with proper support builds lasting confidence.

‚ùå **Myth**: "Panic attacks are just in your head"
‚úÖ **Reality**: They're very real physical experiences that deserve understanding and proper support.

If you're in Hendersonville or surrounding areas and ready to learn evidence-based coping strategies that actually work, you don't have to figure this out alone.

**Ready to move beyond quick fixes to real solutions? Let's talk about how therapy can help you build confidence in managing anxiety. Call today to schedule your consultation.**
