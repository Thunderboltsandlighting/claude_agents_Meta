üíô Quick Tips: Panic Attack Coping Strategies

Panic can feel overwhelming, but you have more power than you think. Here are gentle techniques that can help in those difficult moments:

üå¨Ô∏è **Box Breathing**: Inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat.

üåø **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding**: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.

üí™ **Name It**: Say "I'm having a panic attack. This will pass. I am safe."

ü§≤ **Progressive Relaxation**: Tense and release each muscle group from toes to head.

Remember: These feelings are temporary. You're not alone in this journey, and it's completely okay to seek support.

If panic attacks are impacting your daily life, professional support can make a real difference. At Hendersonville Counseling, we understand what you're going through and we're here to help you find your path to peace.
