**Finding Your Calm in the Storm ðŸŒˆ**

When panic strikes, it can feel overwhelming and isolating. You're not alone in this experience, and there are gentle ways to navigate these difficult moments.

**Grounding techniques that many find helpful:**
âœ¨ 5-4-3-2-1 method: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
âœ¨ Deep breathing: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 6
âœ¨ Cool water on your wrists or face
âœ¨ Remind yourself: "This feeling will pass"

**Daily self-care foundations:**
ðŸŒ± Regular sleep schedule
ðŸŒ± Gentle movement that feels good
ðŸŒ± Staying connected with supportive people
ðŸŒ± Limiting caffeine when possible

Remember, everyone's journey is unique. What works varies from person to person, and that's completely normal.
