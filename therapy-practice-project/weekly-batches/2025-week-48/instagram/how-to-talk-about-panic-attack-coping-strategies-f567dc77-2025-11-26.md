### MAIN CAPTION:

**Finding Your Calm in the Storm ðŸŒˆ**

When panic feels overwhelming, remember that you're not alone in this journey. Many people in our Hendersonville community experience panic, and there are gentle ways to navigate these difficult moments.

**Simple grounding techniques to try:**
â€¢ **5-4-3-2-1 method**: Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste
â€¢ **Box breathing**: Breathe in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4
â€¢ **Cold water** on your wrists or face can help reset your nervous system
â€¢ **Gentle self-talk**: "This feeling will pass. I am safe."

These moments don't define you. With the right support and personalized strategies, you can build confidence in managing anxiety. Every small step forward matters.

If panic is impacting your daily life, you deserve compassionate professional support. At Hendersonville Counseling, we create a safe space to explore what works best for *you*.
