**When your heart races and the world feels overwhelming, you're not alone. üíô**

Panic can feel isolating, but there are gentle, effective ways to navigate these difficult moments. Here are some grounding strategies that many find helpful:

**üå¨Ô∏è The 4-7-8 Breathing Technique**
Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. This helps activate your body's natural calm response.

**üñêÔ∏è The 5-4-3-2-1 Method**
Notice 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. This brings you back to the present moment.

**üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Movement & Cold Water**
Sometimes gentle movement or splashing cold water on your wrists can help reset your nervous system.

Remember, these moments pass. You are stronger than you realize, and seeking support is a sign of courage, not weakness.
