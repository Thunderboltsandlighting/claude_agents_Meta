**Signs You Need Support This Native American Heritage Month üïäÔ∏è**

During Native American Heritage Month, we honor the resilience and strength of Indigenous communities while acknowledging the unique mental health challenges many face.

**You might benefit from support if you're experiencing:**
‚Ä¢ Historical or intergenerational trauma affecting daily life
‚Ä¢ Feeling disconnected from cultural identity or community
‚Ä¢ Struggling with discrimination or cultural misunderstanding
‚Ä¢ Anxiety about preserving traditions for future generations
‚Ä¢ Difficulty balancing traditional and contemporary life
‚Ä¢ Grief related to cultural loss or family history

**Remember:** Seeking help honors your ancestors' strength. Healing isn't just personal‚Äîit ripples through generations, creating positive change for your family and community.

Your mental health matters. Your story matters. Your healing matters.

At Hendersonville Counseling, we provide culturally sensitive support that respects and integrates your heritage into your healing journey. Our trauma-informed approach includes EMDR therapy and individual counseling tailored to your unique experiences.
