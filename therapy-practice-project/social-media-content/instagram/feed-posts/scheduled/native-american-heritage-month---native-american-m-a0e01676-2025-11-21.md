**MAIN CAPTION:**

This Native American Heritage Month, we honor the resilience, wisdom, and cultural richness of Indigenous communities. We also recognize the unique mental health challenges faced by Native Americans, including historical trauma, cultural displacement, and limited access to culturally responsive care.

Self-care strategies rooted in Native traditions can offer profound healing:
üåø **Connection to nature** - Spending time outdoors for grounding and peace
üî• **Ceremony and ritual** - Creating meaningful practices that honor your heritage
üë• **Community gathering** - Building supportive relationships and sharing stories
üé® **Creative expression** - Art, music, and storytelling as emotional outlets
üßò **Mindfulness practices** - Traditional meditation and breathing techniques

Healing happens when we honor both individual needs and cultural identity. Whether you're navigating intergenerational trauma, identity questions, or daily stress, culturally sensitive support can make all the difference.

At Hendersonville Counseling, we believe in honoring your whole story - including your cultural background and ancestral wisdom. You deserve care that respects who you are.
