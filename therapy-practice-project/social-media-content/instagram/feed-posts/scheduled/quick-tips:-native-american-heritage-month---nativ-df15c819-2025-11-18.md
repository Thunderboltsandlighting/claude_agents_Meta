ðŸª¶ **Honoring Native American Heritage Month: Mental Health & Cultural Healing** ðŸª¶

**Quick Support Tips:**

âœ¨ Seek culturally sensitive mental health professionals
âœ¨ Connect with community and traditional practices when possible
âœ¨ Remember that healing often involves the whole person - mind, body, and spirit

Whether you're navigating anxiety, processing historical trauma, or seeking support for life transitions, you deserve compassionate care that honors your whole identity.
