ðŸª¶ **Honoring Native American Heritage Month: Breaking Down Mental Health Myths**

During Native American Heritage Month, let's address some harmful myths that can prevent our community members from seeking the mental health support they deserve:

**Myth:** "Traditional healing and modern therapy can't work together"
**Truth:** Many find strength in combining cultural practices with professional counseling

**Myth:** "Mental health struggles mean you're not spiritually strong"
**Truth:** Seeking help demonstrates courage and wisdom, not weakness

**Myth:** "Therapists won't understand Native experiences"
**Truth:** Culturally-informed therapists honor and integrate your heritage into healing

Historical trauma, discrimination, and cultural disconnection can deeply impact mental wellness. You deserve support that respects your identity while providing evidence-based care.

At Hendersonville Counseling, we believe healing happens when you feel truly seen and understood. Whether you're navigating anxiety, relationship challenges, trauma, or life transitions, we're here to walk alongside you with respect for your cultural identity.

Your heritage is a source of strength, not something to overcome. Let's honor it together in your healing journey.

**Ready to take that brave first step? Call us for a consultation. ðŸ’™**
