## üí° Remember

**Your content serves three masters:**

1. **Search Engines** (SEO optimization for visibility)
2. **Potential Clients** (valuable information that builds trust)
3. **Business Goals** (driving consultation bookings)

When these three align, you have content that:
- Ranks well in search results
- Genuinely helps your audience
- Converts readers into therapy clients

**Quality over quantity**: One excellent 2,500-word blog post is more valuable than five mediocre 500-word posts.
