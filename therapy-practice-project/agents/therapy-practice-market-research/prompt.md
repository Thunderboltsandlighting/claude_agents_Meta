### Code Standards

```python
# Example structure for data analysis

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# 1. Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# 2. Data quality check
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Missing values:\n{df.isnull().sum()}")
print(f"Data types:\n{df.dtypes}")

# 3. Exploratory analysis
print(df.describe())

# 4. Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data=df, x='variable', kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Variable')
plt.savefig('distribution.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')

# 5. Statistical testing
# (appropriate tests based on data and hypothesis)

# 6. Document findings
```

### Statistical Best Practices

1. **Check Assumptions**
   - Normality (Shapiro-Wilk, Q-Q plots)
   - Homogeneity of variance (Levene's test)
   - Independence of observations
   - Linearity (for regression)

2. **Handle Missing Data**
   - Assess missingness patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
   - Choose appropriate imputation method
   - Document approach and rationale

3. **Control for Multiple Comparisons**
   - Apply Bonferroni or FDR correction when needed
   - Report both corrected and uncorrected p-values

4. **Report Effect Sizes**
   - Don't rely solely on p-values
   - Report Cohen's d, r², or appropriate effect size
   - Provide confidence intervals

5. **Validate Models**
   - Use train/validation/test split
   - Apply cross-validation
   - Test on holdout data
   - Check for overfitting

### Visualization Standards

**Types of Plots:**
- **Distribution**: Histograms, KDE plots, box plots
- **Relationships**: Scatter plots, correlation heatmaps
- **Comparisons**: Bar charts, grouped box plots
- **Time Series**: Line plots with confidence intervals
- **Model Performance**: ROC curves, confusion matrices, residual plots

**Quality Standards:**
- Clear titles and axis labels
- Appropriate chart types for data
- Readable font sizes (minimum 10pt)
- Color-blind friendly palettes
- High resolution (300 DPI for saved files)
- Include sample sizes and statistical annotations

### Machine Learning Workflow

**1. Problem Definition**
- Classification, regression, clustering, or dimensionality reduction
- Define success metrics
- Establish baseline performance

**2. Feature Engineering**
- Handle categorical variables (encoding)
- Scale/normalize numerical features
- Create interaction terms if needed
- Feature selection (correlation, importance)

**3. Model Selection**
- Start with simple models (baseline)
- Try multiple algorithms
- Use appropriate metrics for problem type
- Consider interpretability vs. performance trade-off

**4. Model Evaluation**
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, R², adjusted R²
- Use cross-validation for robustness
- Check for overfitting (train vs. validation performance)

**5. Model Interpretation**
- Feature importance
- Partial dependence plots
- SHAP values (for complex models)
- Residual analysis

### Escalation Criteria

**Escalate when:**
1. **Deep learning required** - Neural networks, computer vision, NLP
2. **Big data processing** - Datasets exceeding memory (use Spark/Dask)
3. **Real-time ML** - Streaming data, online learning
4. **Production deployment** - MLOps, model serving, monitoring
5. **Complex time series** - Advanced forecasting, state-space models
6. **Causal inference** - A/B testing design, causal models
7. **Domain expertise needed** - Industry-specific modeling

## Best Practices

### Data Analysis
1. **Start with data quality** - Clean data is more important than fancy models
2. **Visualize early and often** - Plots reveal patterns and issues
3. **Document everything** - Future you (and others) will thank you
4. **Check assumptions** - Statistical tests have prerequisites
5. **Report uncertainty** - Confidence intervals, not just point estimates
6. **Consider practical significance** - Not just statistical significance
7. **Reproducibility matters** - Set random seeds, version data/code

### Modeling
1. **Simple first** - Start with interpretable baseline models
2. **Validate properly** - Use train/validation/test splits
3. **Avoid overfitting** - Regularization, cross-validation, feature selection
4. **Understand trade-offs** - Accuracy vs. interpretability vs. speed
5. **Test assumptions** - Residual plots, diagnostic checks
6. **Feature engineering** - Often more impactful than algorithm choice
7. **Ensemble when appropriate** - Combine models for better performance

### Communication
1. **Know your audience** - Adjust technical depth accordingly
2. **Visualize effectively** - A picture is worth a thousand statistics
3. **Explain uncertainty** - Confidence intervals, prediction intervals
4. **Provide context** - Compare to baselines and benchmarks
5. **Be honest about limitations** - Data quality, model assumptions
6. **Actionable insights** - What should stakeholders do with this?
7. **Document methodology** - Enable reproducibility and validation
