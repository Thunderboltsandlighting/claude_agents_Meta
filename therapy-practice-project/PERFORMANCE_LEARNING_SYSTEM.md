# Performance Learning System

## The Smart Way to Track Content Performance

Instead of manually tracking every post forever, this system learns what works through simple weekly check-ins.

---

## The Problem We Solved

**OLD WAY (Tedious):**
- Track every single post manually
- Update detailed metrics for 20-30 posts/month
- Time-consuming and boring
- Easy to fall behind

**NEW WAY (Smart):**
- ‚úÖ 5-minute weekly check-in
- ‚úÖ Answer simple questions about your week
- ‚úÖ System learns patterns automatically
- ‚úÖ Future content auto-optimized

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Create Content (As Usual)

```bash
python request_social_post.py --topic "ADHD tips" --use-api
python request_social_post.py --topic "Anxiety techniques" --use-api
# ... create 3-7 posts during the week
```

### Step 2: Post Them Manually

- Monday: Post anxiety content
- Wednesday: Post ADHD content
- Friday: Post self-care content

*Track in your head which posts did well!*

### Step 3: Sunday Evening - Weekly Check-In (5 minutes)

```bash
python weekly_checkin.py
```

**System asks simple questions:**

```
üìä WEEKLY PERFORMANCE CHECK-IN

You created 5 posts this week:
1. Monday - Anxiety grounding (Instagram)
2. Wednesday - ADHD tips (Instagram)
3. Thursday - Couples communication (Facebook)
4. Friday - Self-care (Instagram)
5. Saturday - Therapy myths (LinkedIn)

Q1: Which post got the MOST engagement?
    > 2 (ADHD tips)

Q2: How much MORE engagement?
    [X] Way more (2x or more)

Q3: Which post got the LEAST engagement?
    > 5 (LinkedIn therapy myths)

Q4: Did any posts lead to DMs/inquiries?
    [X] Yes - 2 DMs from ADHD post

Q5: Which topic felt most relevant?
    > ADHD and neurodiversity content

Q6: Which platform performed best?
    > Instagram

Q7: What content style worked best?
    > Educational/How-to

Q8: Any timing patterns?
    > Mid-week (Tue-Thu) performed better

Q9: Other observations?
    > Instagram >> Facebook > LinkedIn
    > Educational > inspirational

Q10: Do MORE of?
     > ADHD/neurodiversity topics, educational content

     Do LESS of?
     > LinkedIn posts, inspirational quotes
```

**Time: 5 minutes**
**No exact numbers needed** - just your observations!

### Step 4: System Learns & Optimizes

The system builds a **Performance Profile** (`performance_profile.json`):

```json
{
  "learnings": {
    "topics": {
      "ADHD/neurodiversity": 3,
      "Anxiety management": 2,
      "Couples therapy": 1
    },
    "platforms": {
      "Instagram": 4,
      "Facebook": 1,
      "LinkedIn": 0
    },
    "content_styles": {
      "educational": 3,
      "personal": 1,
      "inspirational": 0
    },
    "timing": {
      "mid_week": 3,
      "weekend": 1
    }
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Create more ADHD/neurodiversity content",
    "Focus on Instagram over other platforms",
    "Use educational style with actionable tips",
    "Schedule for Tuesday-Thursday"
  ]
}
```

### Step 5: Create Better Content Automatically

**Next week, the system knows what works:**

```bash
python create_optimized_content.py \
  --topic "ADHD organization strategies" \
  --use-api \
  --schedule "2025-11-12"
```

**System automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Uses Instagram (your best platform)
- ‚úÖ Schedules for Tuesday (your best day)
- ‚úÖ Uses educational style (your best format)
- ‚úÖ Focuses on proven topics
- ‚úÖ Optimizes for what YOUR audience responds to
